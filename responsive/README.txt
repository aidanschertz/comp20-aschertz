/*README FOR LAB 4 - AIDAN SCHERTZ*/

1. ALL ASPECTS OF THE WORK HAVE BEEN CORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED. USING THE WEB DEVOLOPER TOOL ON CHROME I VERIFIED THE IMAGE OF HOMER SHIFTED WHEN I EXPECTED IT TO.

2. I DISCUSSED THE ASSIGNMENT WITH KINGSLEY (TA) WHO HELPED ME ADJUST THE SYNTAX THAT I WAS USING.

3. I SPENT AT LEAST TWO HOURS ON THE ASSIGNMENT. MOST WAS BECAUSE MY SYNTAX WAS SLIGHTLY OFF AND ONLY ONE IMAGE WOULD SHOW UP FOR ALL SCREEN WIDTHS. I KEPT TRYING TO GOOGLE DIFFERENT RESPONSIVE DESIGN HINTS. APPARENTLY CHANGING FROM (MAX-DEVICE-WIDTH) T0 (MAX-WIDTH) HAD A LARGE IMPACT.
