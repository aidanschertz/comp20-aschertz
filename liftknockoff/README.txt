// README FOR ASSIGNMENT 2 - AIDAN SCHERTZ //

1. I BELIEVE I CORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED ALL ASPECTS OF THE ASSIGNMENT. I AM A PASSENGER, THEREFORE, ALL VEHICLES ARE DISPLAYED WITH THE CORRECT MARKER. WHEN I CLICK ON MYSELF, AN INFO WINDOW PROVIDES MY USERNAME, THE NAME OF THE CLOSEST VEHICLE AND THEIR DISTANCE, AND THE DISTANCE OF THE WEINERMOBILE OR STATEMENT THAT IT IS NOT PRESENT. AFTER OUR STATUS WAS SWTICHED, I WAS ABLE TO VERIFY THAT WHEN I AM A VEHICLE MY CODE WORKS AS WELL. THE ONE THING THAT I AM UNSURE WORKS IS THE DISTANCE OF THE WEINERMOBILE. THE LAST FEW TIMES I CHECKED, THE DISTANCE DISPLAYED IN MY INFO WINDOW AND THE WEINERMOBILE'S HAS BEEN THE SAME. HOWEVER, MINUTE BEFORE, THE DISTANCE DISPLAYED FOR THE WEINERMOBILE IN MY INFO WINDOW WAS DIFFERENT THAN THE DISTANCE DISPLAYED IN THE WEINERMOBILE'S WINDOW. I AM UNSURE WHY THAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED.

2. I DISCUSSED THE ASSIGNMENT WITH KINGSLEY, WHO HELPED ME REALIZE I SHOULD MOVE MY CODE INTO A JS FILE INSTEAD OF <SCRIPT> INSIDE THE HTML, AND SITARA RAO, WHO HELPED ME FIGURE OUT WHY THE OBJECT WAS NOT LOADING, AND MATT WHO HELPED ME FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET MY MARKERS TO DISPLAY.

3. THE ASSIGNMENT TOOK ME 8-9 HOURS TO COMPLETE.
