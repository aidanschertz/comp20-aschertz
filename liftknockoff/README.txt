// README FOR ASSIGNMENT 2 - AIDAN SCHERTZ //

1. I BELIEVE I CORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED ALL ASPECTS OF THE ASSIGNMENT. I AM A PASSENGER, THEREFORE, ALL VEHICLES ARE DISPLAYED WITH THE CORRECT MARKER. WHEN I CLICK ON MYSELF, AN INFO WINDOW PROVIDES MY USERNAME, THE NAME OF THE CLOSEST VEHICLE AND THEIR DISTANCE, AND THE DISTANCE OF THE WEINERMOBILE OR STATEMENT THAT IT IS NOT PRESENT. I WAS NOT ABLE TO CHECK IF MY CODE WORKS IF I WAS A VEHICLE, BUT I BASICALLY DUPLICATED THE CODE, MAKING EACH PASSENGER APPEAR AS CHERRIES INSTEAD OF CARS.

2. I DISCUSSED THE ASSIGNMENT WITH KINGSLEY, WHO HELPED ME REALIZE I SHOULD MOVE MY CODE INTO A JS FILE INSTEAD OF <SCRIPT> INSIDE THE HTML, AND SITARA RAO, WHO HELPED ME FIGURE OUT WHY THE OBJECT WAS NOT LOADING, AND MATT WHO HELPED ME FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET MY MARKERS TO DISPLAY.

3. THE ASSIGNMENT TOOK ME 8-9 HOURS TO COMPLETE.
