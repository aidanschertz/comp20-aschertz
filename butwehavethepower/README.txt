1. I CORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED ALL ASPECTS OF THE ASSIGNMENT TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE. I ANNOTATED THE VIDEO FOR EVERY TWO LINES (BY VERSE) OF LYRICS. 
2. I DISCUSSED THE ASSIGNMENT WITH SITARA RAO, WHO HELPED ME UNDERSTAND HOW TO GET ELEMENTS BY ID AND KINGSLEY, WHO HELPED ME FIGURE OUT WHY THE TEXT AT FIRST WAS NOT CHANGING UNDER MY VIDEO (I HAD AN EXACT TIME IN MY IF STATEMENTS INSTEAD OF A WINDOW OF TIME).
3. THE ASSIGNMENT TOOK ME 3 HOURS TO COMPLETE. IT WAS EASY AFTER I FIGURED OUT HOW TO CHANGE THE LYRICS AFTER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME, THEN YOU JUST REPEAT THIS FOR EVERY VERSE!
